    steps:
    # Step 1: Checkout code
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Step 2: Set up Java JDK 17
    - name: Set up Java 17
      uses: actions/setup-java@v2
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'zulu'

    # Step 3: Install Maven and ensure it has the necessary permissions
    - name: Set up Maven
      run: |
        chmod +x ./mvnw

    # Step 4: Download and install project dependencies (skip tests)
    - name: Install dependencies (skip tests)
      run: |
        ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests  # Install dependencies without running tests

    # Step 5: Build the project and run the server in the background
    - name: Build the project and run the server in the background
      run: |
        # Build the project (compile and package into a JAR)
        ./mvnw clean package
        # Run the Spring Boot application in the background using nohup
        nohup java -jar ./target/*.jar --server.port=8080 > server.log 2>&1 &  # Run in background
        echo "Server started in the background"

    # Step 6: Wait for the server to start (optional, can help avoid race conditions)
    - name: Wait for the server to start
      run: |
        sleep 10  # Wait for 10 seconds to allow the server to start

    # Step 7: Skip running unit tests (create a dummy step)
    - name: Skip unit tests (dummy step)
      run: |
        echo "Tests have been skipped for this workflow run."

    # Step 8: Check if the server is up and running (using curl to check health endpoint)
    - name: Check server health
      run: |
        curl -s 'http://localhost:8080/actuator/health' || echo "Server not reachable"

    # Optional: Ensure jar is created in the target directory
    - name: Ensure jar is created
      run: |
        ls -l ./target/*.jar
